# TAI DDoS GUI

TAI DDoS GUI is an application for performing simple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using PyQt5 as a graphical user interface (GUI) and Requests to send HTTP requests to the target. This application allows users to configure the number of requests, stealth mode, proxy usage, and display attack logs in the GUI.

## DEVELOPER: SABIT

## Features 🚀

- **DDoS Attack**: Sends HTTP requests to the target URL repeatedly 🌐.
- **Stealth Mode**: Uses different `User-Agent` headers to reduce detection 🕵️‍♂️.
- **Proxy**: Option to use proxies automatically 🌍.
- **Attack Logs**: Displays attack status, including successful or failed request counts, in the GUI 📜.
